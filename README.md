# flask-test

## About

This is a project that works with Flask, Docker, and Amazon AWS. 
It sets up a small server for testing HTTP requests within an ECS environment.
The core of this project is testing out ECS and creating a basic template to use in other projects.

## To Do

1. Setup [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) tests to be used as post-deployment tests.
2. Translate `template_setup.sh` and `push.sh` scripts into [TerraForm](https://www.terraform.io/).
